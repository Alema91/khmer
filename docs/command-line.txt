Commandline conventions
=======================

 Throughout this documentation code is surrounded by green boxes, within each
 box says common commandline code conventions are used. Here we will explain a
 number of the use so that you will not get lost.

 The most common example of this is the use of "<variablename>", when you see
 this in code you should replace both the words and the brackets.

You will also see "*".  This represents a universal wildcard, meaning that
it can reference in any  number, letter, or symbol. When this issues within
commandline code all results will show. For example::
		ls *

Will list all files within the current directory. On the other hand, typing::
		ls *.txt

Will display all the text files in the directory.

The vertical bar "|" means that the output of one command is passed directly
into another command.

The less than symbol ">" indicates that the output will be saved to  the
filename that directly follows it.

There are many other commandline conventions not covered in this document, in
fact many books have been written on these. However, this should be enough to
get you through the basic tutorials.
